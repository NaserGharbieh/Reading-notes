# Graphs

A graph is a non-linear data structure that can be looked at as a collection of vertices (or nodes) potentially connected by line segments named edges.

## Common Terminology

- **Vertex:** A data object that can have zero or more adjacent vertices.
- **Edge:** A connection between two nodes.
- **Neighbor:** The adjacent nodes connected via an edge.
- **Degree:** The number of edges connected to a vertex.

# Graphs: Interconnected Data Cities

Graphs are like interconnected cities in a vast network, where each city represents a data point or a "node," and the roads connecting them represent the relationships or "edges" between these nodes. Just as in a city network, you can have different routes to reach a destination, in graphs, there can be multiple paths connecting two nodes. The structure of a graph can be likened to a transportation map, guiding you through the connections between different data points.

## WHY, WHAT, HOW Structure

### Why Graphs?

Graphs provide a flexible way to represent relationships between various entities in a system. They are instrumental in solving problems where understanding connections is crucial.

### What are Graphs?

Graphs consist of nodes (vertices) and edges. Nodes represent individual entities, and edges depict the relationships or connections between these entities. They can be directed (one-way) or undirected (two-way), forming either acyclic structures or cycles.

### How are Graphs Used?

Graphs are used for various purposes, from modeling social networks and transportation systems to solving complex algorithms. They offer versatile representations and are implemented through methods like adjacency matrices or adjacency lists.
