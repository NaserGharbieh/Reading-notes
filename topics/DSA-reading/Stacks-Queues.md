# Stacks and Queues: Unveiling the World of Data Structures

## Introduction: Analogy of Organizing Books

Imagine you're organizing a shelf of books. Stacks and queues are like the shelves with specific rules for arranging and retrieving books. A **stack** is like a pile of plates; you add and remove from the top. A **queue** resembles people standing in line; the first one in is the first one out.

## Deep Dive: Stack Operations and Concepts

**WHAT:** A **stack** is a collection of nodes where new items are placed on top, and the top item is the first to be removed.
**WHY:** It's like a stack of trays in a cafeteria, where you add trays on top and remove from the top when serving.
**HOW:** You **push** a node to the top (adding), **pop** a node from the top (removing), **peek** to see the top node's value, and check if it's **empty**.

### **Example:** Cafeteria Trays

Imagine a cafeteria where trays are stacked. When you add a new tray, you place it on top, and when serving food, you take from the top. If you want to check the top tray's color, you peek. If there are no trays, it's empty.

## Vocabulary/Definition List

- **Stack:** A data structure that follows LIFO (Last In First Out) principle.
- **Push:** Adding a node to the top of a stack.
- **Pop:** Removing a node from the top of a stack.
- **Peek:** Viewing the value of the top node in a stack.
- **Empty:** Checking if a stack has no nodes.

## A Closer Look: Queue Operations and Concepts

**WHAT:** A **queue** is a collection of nodes where new items are added at the rear, and the front item is the first to be removed.
**WHY:** It's like people waiting in line; the person who arrived first leaves first.
**HOW:** You **enqueue** a node to the rear (adding), **dequeue** a node from the front (removing), **peek** to see the front node's value, and check if it's **empty**.

### **Example:** Waiting in Line

Imagine people waiting in line for a bus. The first person in line boards the bus first, and new people join at the rear. The bus driver dequeues passengers from the front. If there's no one, the line is empty.

## Vocabulary/Definition List

- **Queue:** A data structure that follows FIFO (First In First Out) principle.
- **Enqueue:** Adding a node to the rear of a queue.
- **Dequeue:** Removing a node from the front of a queue.
- **Peek:** Viewing the value of the front node in a queue.
- **Empty:** Checking if a queue has no nodes.

## Conclusion: Stacks and Queues in Action

In the realm of data structures, stacks and queues offer organized ways to manage items. Stacks are like trays in a cafeteria, while queues resemble people in line. They provide efficient methods for adding, removing, and inspecting elements, making them crucial tools for various applications in computer science.
